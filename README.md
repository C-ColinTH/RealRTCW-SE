# RealRTCW-SE

RealRTCW-SE (Special Edition for Localization) is a fork version based on wolfetplayer's [RealRTCW](https://github.com/wolfetplayer/RealRTCW).

What chages:
* Subtitle can display images, thus showcasing translated content as RTCW cannot display characters from character sets other than ISO-8859-1.
* Increased core shader limit, thus more images can be loaded.
* Increased script stack item limit.
* And some other minor modifications to some functions to display localized content.

Note:  
* Default branch "master" is not the RealRTCW-SE respository, please switch branch to view RealRTCW-SE files.
* I am not a programmer, I only have a small understanding of C language during my university years, so some of the program code for implementing certain functions may appear somewhat bizarre and unusual. Additionally, I am new to using GitHub and therefore not very familiar with it. Please forgive me.

Welcome to provide improvement suggestions for the code.
